About My Project : 

My project is a clone of a http://www.moo.com/, where we can choose different cards and select the type of design they want on the cards .

Guide to Project:

In the Home page Navbar is there for navigating to all the pages . The Navigation Bar contains a Drop-Down from which one can select a particular Category to purchase or design. 
After selecting a particular categories , it takes us to a new page where the user will be able to see lots of products. 

After selecting a product User can see the detail information about the product  and can add it to the cart if he or she find any particular product of his or her intrest. 

There is also a Log-in functonality where user can sign up 
So this is basically my project. I completed the whole project in the construct week timeline.  

All the resources which are used in the project either I fetch those from main website or I took from google. All the resources are belongs to their respective owners. I don't have anykind of ownership over any resources. All images are taken from moo.com,. All icons and fonts taken from open sources from google search.
